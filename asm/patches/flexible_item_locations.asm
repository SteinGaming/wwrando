; Normally the Great Fairies will give you the next tier max-up upgrade, depending on what you currently have.
; So if you already got the 1000 Rupee Wallet from one Great Fairy, the second one will give you the 5000 Rupee Wallet, regardless of the order you reach them in.
; This patch changes it so they always give a constant item even if you already have it, so that the item can be randomized safely.

; The 6 Heart Containers that appear after you kill a boss are all created by the function createItemForBoss.
; createItemForBoss hardcodes the item ID 8, and doesn't care which boss was just killed. This makes it hard to randomize boss drops without changing all 6 in sync.
; So we make some changes to createItemForBoss and the places that call it so that each boss can give a different item.
.open "sys/main.dol"
; First we modify the createItemForBoss function itself to not hardcode the item ID as 8 (Heart Container).
; We nop out the two instructions that load 8 into r4. This way it simply passes whatever it got as argument r4 into the next function call to createItem.

; Second we modify the code for the "disappear" cloud of smoke when the boss dies.
; This cloud of smoke is what spawns the item when Gohma, Kalle Demos, Helmaroc King, and Jalhalla die.
; So we need a way to pass the item ID from the boss's code to the disappear cloud's parameters and store them there.
; We do this by hijacking argument r7 when the boss calls createDisappear.
; Normally argument r7 is a byte, and gets stored to the disappear's params with mask 00FF0000.
; We change it to be a halfword and stored with the mask FFFF0000.
; The lower byte is unchanged from vanilla, it's still whatever argument r7 used to be for.
; But the upper byte, which used to be unused, now has the item ID in it.
.org 0x80027AC4 ; In fopAcM_createDisappear

; Third we change how the boss item ACTR calls createItemForBoss.
; (This is the ACTR that appears if the player skips getting the boss item after killing the boss, and instead comes back and does the whole dungeon again.)
; Normally it sets argument r4 to 1, but createItemForBoss doesn't even use argument r4.
; So we change it to load one of its params (mask: 0000FF00) and use that as argument r4.
; This param was unused and just 00 in the original game, but the randomizer will set it to the item ID it randomizes to that location.
; Then we will be calling createItemForBoss with the item ID to spawn in argument r4. Which due to the above change, will be used correctly now.
.open "files/rels/d_a_boss_item.rel"
.org 0x1C4 ; In daBossItem_Create
  lbz r4, 0x00B2(r30)
.close
; The final change necessary is for all 6 bosses' code to be modified so that they pass the item ID to spawn to a function call.
; For Gohdan and Molgera, the call is to createItemForBoss directly, so argument r4 needs to be the item ID.
; For Gohma, Kalle Demos, Helmaroc King, and Jalhalla, they instead call createDisappear, so we need to upper byte of argument r7 to have the item ID.
; But the randomizer itself handles all 6 of these changes when randomizing, since these locations are all listed in the "Paths" of each item location. So no need to do anything here.




; The heart container item get function (item_func_utuwa_heart) usually handles setting the flag for having taken the current dungeon's boss item.
; But if the player got a heart container somewhere in a dungeon other than from the boss, this could cause the boss's actual item to disappear.
; We modify the code to remove the calls to set the flag.

; Normally when the player takes a boss item drop, it would not set the flag for having taken the current dungeon's boss item, since in vanilla that was handled by the heart container's item get function.
; That could allow the player to get the item over and over again since the item never disappears.
; So we modify createItemForBoss to pass an item flag to createItem, so that the item properly keeps track of whether it has been taken.
; We use item pickup flag 0x15 for all boss items, since that flag is not used by any items in any of the dungeons.
; (Note that since we're just setting an item flag, the special flag for the dungeon's boss item being taken is never set. But I don't believe that should cause any issues.)

; Allow pots to drop any item in the game.
; In vanilla, pots could only drop certain items, mostly consumables.
; This is because their item ID parameter, which ranged from 0x00-0x3F, was passed to fopAcM_createItemFromTable.
; That function treats IDs 0x00-0x1F as normal item IDs, while it treats 0x20-0x3F as indexes in the random item drop table.
; We add a new parameter to pots: z_rot&0xFF00.
; This acts as a normal item ID passed to fopAcM_createItem, which can create any item, allowing pots to be randomized.
